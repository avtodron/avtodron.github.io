            <h2 class="text">The Bat Suit</h2>
            <p class="text2">The Batsuit has an electrical system that can shock assailants as a last resort. The Batsuit is made of triple-weave Kevlar centered around the most obvious target, the chest-mounted Bat symbol, which in part is intended to lure gunshots to the armor's thickest point. Though the suit has been drawn many different ways by different artists, and the stories themselves have described Batman as modifying the details of his costume from time to time, it is most often depicted as consisting of a scalloped cape, a bat-like cowl, a pair of gloves, boots, a yellow utility belt, and a tight-fitting body suit with the image of a bat emblazoned on the chest.</p>

            <h2 class="text">The Bat Bike</h2>
            <p class="text2">The Batcycle is known as the Batpod for The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012).[4][5][6] The bike has 20" front and rear tires and is powered by a high-performance, water-cooled, single-cylinder engine - geared toward the lower end for faster acceleration and with no exhaust pipes: the exhaust is routed through the hollow steel/aluminum/magnesium tubing used for the frame of the bike.[7] The Batpod is steered by the shoulders instead of hands, and the rider's arms are protected by shields.</p>

            <h2 class="text">The Batmobile</h2>
            <p class="text2">The Batmobile is the fictional car driven by the superhero Batman. Housed in the Batcave,[1] which it accesses through a hidden entrance, the Batmobile is both a heavily armored tactical assault vehicle and a personalized custom-built pursuit and capture vehicle that is used by Batman in his fight against crime.[2] Using the latest civilian performance technology, coupled with prototype military-grade hardware—most of which was developed by Wayne Enterprises—Batman creates an imposing hybrid monster to prowl the streets of Gotham City.</p>
